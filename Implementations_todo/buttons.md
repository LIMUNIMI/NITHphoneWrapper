I want to introduce a new feature. A new page where there are two large buttons, that occupy all the screen, and from where you can go back by pressing the back button.

when the page is opened, two more parameters in the extra field (after the ^) will appear: button1=true/false&button2=true/false

WHILE a button is pressed, it will send a true flag, when not pressed a false flag.
